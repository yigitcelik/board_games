Our journey through the vast landscape of board games begins with a dataset encompassing over 20,000 ranked board games from BoardGameGeek (BGG). Through rigorous analysis, I've unearthed valuable insights and crafted a content-based game recommender system to guide your next game night.\n","\n","The odyssey commences with a keen eye on anomalies in critical features, prompting meticulous data cleaning. From eliminating rows with zero popularity to trimming extreme values, each step ensures the dataset's integrity. A new feature, 'subjective_popularity,' becomes the North Star, blending user ratings, BGG rank, average rating, and rating ratio with precision weights.\n","\n","Navigating through temporal shifts, I've excluded games from the distant past and the uncertain present to refine our recommendations. The exploration extends to age requirements, players' count, and playtime, aligning the dataset with a discerning eye for quality recommendations.\n","\n","Imputation strategies, from zero-player adjustments to predicting missing 'Owned Users' values, add finesse to our dataset. The correlation dance among playtime, age, complexity, and ratings reveals the subtle nuances of board game dynamics.\n","\n","The tale unfolds with intriguing observations. A paradoxical trend emerges where user engagement declines, but game ratings soar after 2015, hinting at a shift in game creation motives. The impact of the number of players on average ratings remains negligible, and games tailored for adolescents shine as unexpected gems.\n","\n","In conclusion, our content-based recommender system, fueled by the robust cosine similarity, stands ready to curate your next gaming adventure. From the classics to hidden gems, let data be your guide in the enchanting world of board games. Roll the dice, make your move, and let the games begin!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4f1bea64-5b2f-4203-a054-404640b8eda3","metadata":{},"source":["# Unraveling the Board Game Enigma: Data-Driven Recommendations\n","\n","In the world of board games, there's a game for every occasion and a playstyle for every group.
